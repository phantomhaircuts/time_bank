## Technical Requirements

How well does your app demonstrate a grasp of the technologies introduced in class?

**Meets expectations**

**Comments**: While there are a few ways you can polish up your app, it seems
like you've got the fundamentals of MVC down. I think the main issues I saw
were related to when to pass information in via a form, vs when to use
current_user to securly determine who's logged in.

I like that you managed to get a many-to-many relationship (transactions) to
work, great job!

## Project Workflow

How effectively did you plan, execute, and present this project?

**Does not meet expectations**

**Comments**: I will start by saying that it seems like your overall approach
and execution of this project was pretty good. That said, I  marked this as
'does not meet' because I can't find any user stories or wireframes related to
this project.

## Creativity/Interface

How memorable and enjoyable to use is your app?

**Meets expectations**

**Comments**: I really like this idea, and it's pretty well executed for an
Project 2 MVP! Your design is nice and clean... the main reason I didn't give an
'execeeds' is that there a number of places where the UX / UI could use some
polish (e.g. when creating a new profile, the header just says 'new').

## Code Quality

Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

**Meets expectations**

**Comments**: Overall you did a pretty good job w/ code quality. Still some
minor issues with indentation and style, but nothing major. See my in-line
comments for more.

## Deployment and Functionality

How accessible is your app to those who may want to explore it?

**Meets expectations**

**Comments**: Overall the functionality is solid, and it works as expected on
heroku. The suggestions for improvement here are related to adding authorization.
Right now, I can create / edit services/profiles for anyone else... it would be
good to remove those links and also lock down the controllers to prevent that.
